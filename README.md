Dont be bozo and just run it, install depedencies first before running in command line. Edit the file and include your desired paths, and paths to your ffmpeg.exe and path to your client_secret.json. client_secret.json can be found by setting up youtube api v3 in google developer console. 

Yes, this is very complicated, its just me playing around. Simpler version coming soon

If you dont know how to set up youtube api, just do manuall upload. the video is there for you, move ur fingers!
